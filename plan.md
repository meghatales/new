Current plan is not suitable as it does not reflect the updated priorities. I need to update the plan to prioritize the PDF library and bookstore features, followed by the education section and magazine. User account management should be integrated throughout the development process. The donation button and user-generated story features should be considered optional or lower priority. The new plan should be:
1. Initialize Next.js project with Tailwind CSS and Firebase integration.
2. Implement PDF library with time-limited preview and subscription options.
3. Develop the bookstore functionality with product display, cart, and checkout.
4. Create the Meghalaya education section with PDF uploads and downloads.
5. Build the weekly magazine section with article display and management.
6. Implement user account management (signup, login, profile).
7. Ensure responsive design and test thoroughly.
8. Deploy the application and provide documentation.
